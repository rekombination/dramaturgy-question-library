The role of a dramaturg is fundamentally about asking the right questions at the right time. But what makes a question "right," and how do we develop this crucial skill?

## The Power of Questions

In theatre, questions are not just tools for gathering information—they are catalysts for discovery. A well-posed question can:

- Open up new interpretive possibilities
- Challenge assumptions about character or narrative
- Reveal hidden themes and connections
- Create space for collaborative exploration

## Questions vs. Solutions

One of the most important lessons for emerging dramaturgs is learning to resist the urge to provide solutions. When we jump to answers too quickly, we short-circuit the creative process. Instead, we need to cultivate the patience to sit with uncertainty.

Consider the difference between these approaches:

**Solution-focused**: "I think this scene should be cut because it's too long."

**Question-focused**: "What work is this scene doing? What would we lose if it weren't here? Are there moments within it that feel essential?"

The question-focused approach invites the entire creative team into the investigation, rather than shutting down conversation with a definitive answer.

## Timing Matters

Not all questions are appropriate at all stages of the process. Early in development, broad, open-ended questions help establish the world of the play:

- What world are we creating?
- Who is this story for?
- What questions does this piece ask of its audience?

As rehearsals progress, questions can become more specific and focused:

- Why does this character make this choice at this moment?
- What relationship does this production have with the original text?
- How does this design choice support or complicate our interpretation?

## Building a Question Practice

Developing the art of asking questions requires:

1. **Deep listening**: Understanding what the artists are trying to achieve
2. **Curiosity without agenda**: Genuine interest rather than leading questions
3. **Trust in the process**: Believing that exploration leads somewhere valuable
4. **Self-awareness**: Recognizing when your questions come from fear or control

## The Question as Gift

Ultimately, a good dramaturgical question is a gift to the creative team—an offering that says, "I trust you to explore this, and I'm here to support that exploration."

The art of asking questions is never fully mastered. It requires constant practice, reflection, and refinement. But it remains one of the most powerful tools in the dramaturg's toolkit.
